### 7.3 Additive groups

The group operation $\oplus$ can be specified by an $n \times n$ table whose entries are of the form $a_i \oplus a_j$ (row $i$, column $j$). If $a_j \neq a_k$ then $a_i \oplus a_j \neq a_i \oplus a_k$ and this means that any elements in any row of the addition table are distinct, that is, each row contains each element of the group $G$ exactly once, and the same goes for the columns.

### 7.3.1 Alternative group axioms

The previously mentioned property of addition can be seen as a permutation of $G$, that is, each row of the table actually represents the set of the elements of $G$ in a different order. This property can be taken as one of the group axioms.

**Theorem 7.1** Let $G = \{ a, b, c, \dots \}$ be a set of elements on which the $\oplus$ operation is defined. Then $G$ is a group under the operation $\oplus$ if and only if:

- The operation is associative.
- There is an indentity element.
- For each $a \in G$, $a \oplus G$ is a permutation of $G$.

**Proof**. Basically we can derive the existence and uniqueness of inverses starting from the latter property, and also the algebraic closure, making the algebraic structure an additive group.
